# hupu_project

This is an undergraduate graduation project of mine. This graduation project aims to design and implement a simple sports news recommendation system. This part focuses on the collection and analysis of news data from research websites.

First, a crawler program is designed based on python's requests and bs4 modules to search for news data of related websites and preprocess the data by stuttering word segmentation and other methods. 

Secondly, through the comparison and analysis of various existing recommendation algorithms, a content-based weighted hybrid recommendation algorithm is concluded, which will effectively provide users with the news reports they care about most.
